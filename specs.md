I have tried my best to make the specification easy to read and implement, so if you come across
any inconsistencies or experience any difficulty, do let me know by sending an
email [here](ccayreen24@gmail.com),
or by reporting an issue in the [specification
repo](https://github.com/catherine244/NewsHighlight/issues).
